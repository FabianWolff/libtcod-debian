Comment:   The following files fall under some informal dedication to
           the public domain:
           .
             python/samples_py.py
             samples/hmtool/*
             samples/samples_c.c
             samples/samples_cpp.cpp
           .
           However, since it is not explained exactly what exemption
           those files have from default copyright restrictions, those
           dedications are probably not legally binding, in which case
           the files are covered by the top-level BSD-3-clause license
           as described in LIBTCOD-LICENSE.txt.
